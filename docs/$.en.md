helper procedure to simplify accessing the sub-properties
It can also be used in 'property.sub-property' syntax, which will behave like getSub above.  

Provides the following shortcuts:
* If the parameter is not a string, it simply returns the parameter(as JSON)
* If the return value is an Array with only one element, it will return the content of that element
* If the return value is an object and has a property called `value` it will return the content of that
