This function allows you to return different results based on various conditions. It checks multiple conditions sequentially and returns the corresponding value as soon as a condition is met.

##### Parameters
* **condition_x** - An expression that evaluates to true or false.
* **replacement_x** - The value to be returned if the corresponding condition is true.
* **fallback** (optional) - A value to be returned if none of the conditions are met.

##### Examples
* `decodeConditions($('a') > 10, "greater than 10", $('a') < 5, 'less than 5', "something in between")`
* `decodeConditions($('a') > 0, "positive", $('a') < 0, 'negative', "equal to zero")`
* `decodeConditions($('a').length > 10, "long text", $('a').length == 0, 'empty text')`
